# Java OOP Assignment: MyPoint, MyLine, and MyRectangle Classes

## Overview
This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using Java by implementing classes that model points, lines, and rectangles.

## Classes Implemented

### 1. `MyPoint`
- Represents a point in a 2D space with `x` and `y` coordinates.
- Provides methods to:
  - Get and set coordinates.
  - Calculate the distance between two points.

### 2. `MyLine`
- Represents a line segment using two `MyPoint` instances (begin and end points).
- Provides methods to:
  - Get and set the endpoints.
  - Calculate line length and gradient.

### 3. `MyRectangle`
- Represents a rectangle defined by two `MyPoint` instances (top-left and bottom-right corners).
- Provides methods to:
  - Get width, height, area, and perimeter.

## Test Classes
- **`TestMyLine.java`**: Tests all methods in `MyLine` class.
- **`TestMyRectangle.java`**: Tests all methods in `MyRectangle` class.

## Notes
- The `toString()` methods have been replaced with `toFormattedString()` for better output readability.
- Old implementations are commented out for reference.

# Credit Card System ðŸ’³

A simple Java-based Credit Card system demonstrating **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts such as **aggregation**, **encapsulation**, **method overloading**, and **copy constructors**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Money Class**: Handles monetary values with precision.
- **Address & Person Classes**: Stores customer details.
- **CreditCard Class**: Manages credit card transactions securely.
- **Encapsulation & Security**: Prevents direct access to internal financial data.
- **Method Overloading**: Implements a copy constructor for `Money`.
